## How it works

## Requirement
- **Ableton Live Suite for Mac 10.1.2** or later 
- Or if you really need to use a previous version of Ableton Live Suite 10.x,  you have to update your Node for Max package to the latest version (version 1.2.3 or later) through Package Manager, or use the latest version of Max (8.1.0 or later)
- **Currently the device supports Mac OS only.**  


## Known problems
~~- When you keep generating rhythms continuiously, Node for Max crashes with "Max API Timeout" error in some occasions and you'll see "Model is not trained yet" error message.~~
- Incompatible with folders with names containing special characters such as `[]?*!|@`
- Changes you make on the sequence grid view are not reflected the rhythm sequence. It is just a display! 


## TO DO
- *Windows Version!!* 
- ~~Fix "Max API Timeout" error~~
- ~~save/load functionaly for trained models~~
- better documentation
- better UI design!!
- ~~custom MIDI note number settings~~
- add a feature to add random noise to `z` 


## Updates
- 2019.12.27 fxied| onset/velocity/offset training data used be shuffled independently. it makes no sense! 
- 2019.11.10 added| Time shift parameter / MIDI Mapping
- 2019.10.19 fixed| beat sync issue
- 2019.10.18 added| note on the requirement
- 2019.9.14 added| functionality to save/load trained model

## MIDI Mapping

This devices considers the following 9 drum types:

  | Drum Types |
  |:-----:|
  | Kick  |
  | Snare |
  |Hi-hat closed |
  |Hi-hat open |
  |Tom low|
  |Tom mid|
  |Tom high|
  |Clap|
  |Rim|

MIDI notes in a MIDI file will be classified into the 9 types based on [General MIDI (GM) Mapping](https://www.midi.org/specifications-old/item/gm-level-1-sound-set).
